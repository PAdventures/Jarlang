# Jarlang

Jarlang is an interpreted programming language which mainly uses syntax similar to Rust and Javascript. Jarlang's interpreter is written in Rust.

### Note

This project was originally made by following the YouTube tutorial created by [tylerlaceby](https://www.youtube.com/@tylerlaceby) using TypeScript,
please show them some love for their amazing channel. I have just decided to use Rust which requires a bit more thought on how Runtime Values need to be stored.

This is a personal project and being uploaded to GitHub for others to look at :)
